# Minecraft painful mod

## Changelog

### Version 1.0 Deprecation Notice

**Note:** The V1.0 version of this mod is now deprecated.

Version 1.0 relied on a computer vision (CV) based method utilizing image recognition directly from the game. While it provided an interesting concept, its accuracy was not perfect. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue this version. All relevant data and code can be found in the "PythonTest" folder.

### Current Mod Status

The Painful-Minecraft Mod is now fully operational and nearly complete. To make it functional, all you need to do is update the URL in the request to match the IP address of your ESP32 device. Additionally, the ESP32 code has been finalized, and we will soon be providing schematics for your convenience.
